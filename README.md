3. Install the plugin.
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Once the plugin is installed and activated, you will be able to access a new menu under settings called "Instamojo Payment Gateway for WooCommerce".

***Configuration***

Now go to WooCommerce's settings tab (left sidebar on your WordPress dashboard) --> Settings --> Checkout --> Instamojo.
